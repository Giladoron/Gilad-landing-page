# Commit and Deploy

When the user asks to **"commit and deploy"** (or equivalent: "deploy", "commit and push", "ship it"):

1. **Stage all changes**: `git add -A`
2. **Check status**: `git status` (show user what will be committed)
3. **Commit**: `git commit -m "<message>"`  
   Use a short, clear message (e.g. "Update hero copy", "Fix form validation"). If the user gave a message, use that.
4. **Push**: `git push origin main`

**Requirements:**
- Request **git_write** permission when running git commit/push.
- Only commit if there are staged changes; if nothing to commit, say so and skip.
- Default branch is `main`; if the repo uses `master`, use that instead.

**After push:** GitHub Actions runs the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow. The site updates at `https://<username>.github.io/Gilad-landing-page/` when the workflow completes. No need to run `npm run deploy` locally—CI does it with GitHub Secrets.

**Docs:** See `docs/DEPLOY_FROM_NEW_ACCOUNT.md` for one-time repo setup and GitHub Secrets.
